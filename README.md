## Features

  * fetch JSON data
  * List the trees
  * On click open the photos of the tree
  * Filter trees by name
  * Mobile friendly

## Ideas for improvement

  * What if the API return tones of photos? Some infinite scrolling or pagination
  * API schema validation
  * StyledComponents for CSS
  * Error reporting, so that we know what goes wrong before users need to tell us
  * End to end testing using Cypress etc.
