# Treemendous Tree Viewer

This is a tree viewer that reads somme tree meta data from a JSON end point and represents them in your browser.



## Install

```
yarn
```

## Develop

```
yarn start
```

## Features

  * fetch JSON data
  * List the trees
  * On click open the photos of the tree

## Ideas for improvement

  * What if the API return tones of photos? Some infinite scrolling or pagination
  * API schema validation
  * StyledComponents for CSS
  * Error reporting, so that we know what goes wrong before users need to tell us
